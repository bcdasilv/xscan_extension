# xscan_extension
We have implemented an extension of the XScab tool (Eclipse plugin), which was previously implemented by researchers at IOWA State University.

You can find the original tool at: http://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~hungnv/Research/XScan/

Two main features implemented in this extension:
   * LCbC computation over the XSCan concern mapping.
   * CSV exportation of LCbC computation.

In order to know how to run XScan, please read the "XScan Documention.pdf" file provided by the original developers.
We haven't changed this procedure.
